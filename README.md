# vue-form-example
A quick example demonstrating Vue 2.x forms.

Created by [@yomete](https://github.com/yomete) and published as [an imperative guide to forms in Vue.js](https://blog.logrocket.com/an-imperative-guide-to-forms-in-vue-js-2/), it seems to be quite popular amongst Google searchers. However it has only been available as a [CodePen](https://codepen.io/olayinkaos/pen/GMmpPm) and was never uploaded to GitHub up until now.

All in all it's a great little boilerplate for Vue forms.

## Project setup
```
yarn install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
yarn serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
yarn build
```

### Gotchas and changes
The original coder chose to use [VeeValidate](https://logaretm.github.io/vee-validate/) 2.x which is not fully compatible with its latest release. However I did not migrate the project to 3.x to keep it as much in par with the original article.

Also some minor bugs were ironed out (like missing keys in list bindings).
